# Sarcasm-Detection
This project presents a hybrid sarcasm detection system that leverages the strengths of both deep learning and traditional machine learning. The model combines the sequential understanding of BiLSTM with the contextual power of BERT. A Random Forest classifier is then used to intelligently fuse the outputs from both models
## ðŸ“Œ Features

- ðŸ§¾ **BiLSTM Model** for capturing sequential and syntactic patterns in text.
- ðŸ“š **BERT Model** for deep contextual language understanding.
- ðŸŒ² **Random Forest Classifier** to ensemble predictions from BiLSTM and BERT.
- ðŸ“Š Trained on the Reddit Comments dataset[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danofer/sarcasm/data].
- ðŸ“ˆ achieved an accuracy of 75.26%.
