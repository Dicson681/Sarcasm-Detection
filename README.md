# Sarcasm-Detection
This project presents a hybrid sarcasm detection system that leverages the strengths of both deep learning and traditional machine learning. The model combines the sequential understanding of BiLSTM with the contextual power of BERT. A Random Forest classifier is then used to intelligently fuse the outputs from both models
